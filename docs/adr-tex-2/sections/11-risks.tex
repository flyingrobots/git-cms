\section{Risks \& Technical Debt}

\subsection{Risk 1: SHA-1 Collision}
Git's reliance on SHA-1 is a known cryptographic risk. While the likelihood of a practical attack on a blog is low, the system should monitor Git's transition to SHA-256.

\subsection{Risk 2: Repository Growth}
Every draft save creates a permanent commit. Over years of active use, the object store could grow significantly. Regular \texttt{git gc --aggressive} and ref pruning strategies are needed.

\subsection{Risk 3: Unauthenticated Write Interface}
The HTTP API intentionally has no built-in authentication in this architecture. Exposing it beyond trusted local or tunneled environments can permit unauthorized content writes.

\textbf{Mitigation:} Bind the service to trusted interfaces only, protect it behind SSH tunneling or an authenticated reverse proxy, and restrict CORS/origin policy in deployment.

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Item} & \textbf{Priority} & \textbf{Impact} \\
\midrule
Automated ref pruning & High & Reduces repo bloat \\
Retry logic for CAS conflicts & Medium & Improves concurrent editing \\
External index for large ref counts & Medium & Improves \texttt{listArticles} performance \\
Built-in auth for HTTP write endpoints & Medium & Reduces accidental exposure risk \\
