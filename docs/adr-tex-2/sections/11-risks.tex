\section{Risks \& Technical Debt}

\subsection{Risk 1: SHA-1 Collision}
Git's reliance on SHA-1 is a known cryptographic risk. While the likelihood of a practical attack on a blog is low, the system should monitor Git's transition to SHA-256.

\subsection{Risk 2: Repository Growth}
Every draft save creates a permanent commit. Over years of active use, the object store could grow significantly. Regular \texttt{git gc --aggressive} and ref pruning strategies are needed.

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Item} & \textbf{Priority} & \textbf{Impact} \\
\midrule
Automated ref pruning & High & Reduces repo bloat \\
Retry logic for CAS conflicts & Medium & Improves concurrent editing \\
External index for large ref counts & Medium & Improves \texttt{listArticles} performance \\
