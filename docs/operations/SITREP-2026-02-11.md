# SITREP: git-cms

- Report Date: 2026-02-11
- Report Time (UTC): 2026-02-11T19:22:00Z
- Reporting Unit: `git-cms` repository
- Reporting Scope: Codebase status, roadmap alignment, immediate blockers

## 1. Situation

`git-cms` is operational as a core prototype/service with validated local and Docker integration behavior. OPORD-01 (CLEAN-LIFT) has been executed for this cycle, moving packaging/install from local-path assumptions to reproducible npm-based installs.

## 2. Current Capability Snapshot

- Core domain service present: `src/lib/CmsService.js`
- CLI present: `bin/git-cms.js` (`draft`, `publish`, `list`, `show`, `serve`)
- HTTP API present: `src/server/index.js`
- Admin static UI served from `public/`
- Verification commands currently passing:
  - Command: `npm run check:deps`
  - Result: dependency integrity checks pass (no local-path/link lockfile regressions)
  - Command: `npm run test:setup`
  - Result: setup-script BATS suite passes
  - Command: `npm run test:local`
  - Result: 3 test files passed, 8 tests passed
  - Command: `npm test`
  - Result: Docker test harness passes (3 test files, 8 tests)

## 3. Recent Completed Work (This Cycle)

- Package migration alignment applied in runtime code:
  - `@git-stunts/cas` -> `@git-stunts/git-cas`
  - `@git-stunts/empty-graph` -> `@git-stunts/git-warp`
- `CmsService` updated for current package APIs:
  - `GitGraphAdapter` for graph commit/read/ref operations
  - `GitRepositoryService` for ref updates
  - `trailer-codec` decode call and newline behavior adjusted
- Added dependency-integrity guard:
  - `scripts/check-dependency-integrity.mjs`
  - CI gate in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with pre/post-install checks
- Docker/compose migration completed to repo-local context with Node 22 baseline.
- Setup/demo/quickstart and setup tests updated to remove stale sibling-repo requirements.
- Runtime resilience guard added for `@git-stunts/vault` import failure:
  - `src/lib/VaultResolver.js` dynamically loads vault and degrades safely.

## 4. Roadmap Position Assessment

Status key:
- `GREEN`: implemented and verified
- `AMBER`: partial/in progress
- `RED`: planned/not yet implemented

| Milestone | Status | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| M0 Packaging + Infra | AMBER | PP3-style clean install hardening is operational in-repo; publish/release sequencing for `git-cms` (PP4) remains. |
| M1 Core Content Model | RED/AMBER | Draft/publish flow exists, but formal Content ID/slug spec and explicit state machine are not fully implemented. |
| M2 Editor UX | RED | Planned; no milestone-complete implementation sequence yet. |
| M3 Delivery | RED/AMBER | Basic API exists, but roadmap-level delivery requirements (versioned public API/SSG integration and management semantics) remain. |
| M4 Media | RED/AMBER | Upload path exists; full media library workflow is not implemented. |
| M5 Security + Roles | RED | Authentication/RBAC not implemented. |
| M6 Polish | RED | Planned; depends on M1-M3 stabilization. |

## 5. Principal Risks / Friction

- External package quality risk:
  - Published `@git-stunts/vault@1.0.0` can fail at import in some environments.
  - Mitigation in place via `VaultResolver` fallback behavior; upstream package fix still recommended.
- Resilience gap:
  - Retry policy integration in `CmsService` is still pending (called out in ADR technical debt).
- Model governance gap:
  - No formal, enforced Content ID and slug policy document/mechanism matching M1.1 acceptance criteria.
- Transition semantics gap:
  - Draft/publish behavior works, but full explicit state machine semantics for unpublish/revert are not yet formalized in code.

## 6. Current Repository State

Branch status at reporting time:

- Branch: `git-stunts`
- Worktree: dirty (multiple modified files, including runtime, dependencies, and docs)

This indicates active integration work and documentation updates are in progress, not yet cut into a stabilization commit.

## 7. Commander’s Critical Information Requirements (CCIR)

- CCIR-1: Can this repo be installed and tested from a clean checkout with no local sibling repos?
- CCIR-2: Are Content ID and slug invariants codified and enforced at all ingress paths (CLI + API)?
- CCIR-3: Is publish/unpublish/revert behavior deterministic under concurrent write attempts?
- CCIR-4: Are transient git failures retried safely without duplicate writes?

## 8. Recommended Immediate Priorities (Next 1-2 Sprints)

1. Finalize OPORD-01 by merging and watching CI `dependency-guard` in default branch.
2. Execute OPORD-02 / M1.1 (Content ID and slug specification + enforcement + tests).
3. Execute OPORD-03 / M1.2 (explicit state machine + transition policy + tests).
4. Execute OPORD-04 / INF2 resilience integration with deterministic retry behavior.

## 9. Overall Assessment

Operationally viable prototype with a clear roadmap and passing local + Docker tests. Packaging/install substrate has advanced to release-grade guardrails this cycle; next decisive progress depends on formalizing content identity/state contracts and adding resilience policy enforcement.
